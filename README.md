Pokémon FireRed – Johto Expansion (Source Project)

This repository is a personal fork of the pret/pokefirered disassembly.
It serves as a development workspace for a custom FireRed‑based project that expands the game with a full Johto region and additional original areas. The goal is to maintain a clean, reproducible source tree while building new maps, layouts, scripts, and engine‑level features on top of the existing FireRed engine.
Project Overview

This fork includes:

    Integration of all Johto maps, layouts, and headers

    Additional custom regions and experimental areas

    Updated map groups, connections, and event data

    Layout and tileset additions required for new regions

    A stable base for future engine modifications

The project is actively evolving and serves both as a development sandbox and a long‑term foundation for future content.
Repository Structure

Key directories include:

    data/maps/ — All Kanto, Johto, and custom region maps

    data/layouts/ — Map layouts and layout tables

    data/scripts/ — Event scripts and map‑specific logic

    data/tilesets/ — Tileset definitions and related assets

    src/ — Engine code and modifications

    tools/ — Build tools used by the pret engine

This structure follows the standard pret layout with additional regions layered in.
Upstream Project

This work is based on the original pret FireRed disassembly:
https://github.com/pret/pokefirered (github.com in Bing)

All build instructions, toolchain details, and engine documentation can be found there.
Purpose of This Fork

This project exists to:

    Provide a clean, maintainable base for custom region development

    Support ongoing work on Johto and other new areas

    Serve as a portfolio‑ready example of ROM hacking, scripting, and engine integration

    Offer a reproducible environment for testing and iteration

It is not intended as a public release of a finished game, but rather as the source code behind an active development effort.
